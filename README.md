The DBD Pip Tracker overlay is a really simple and lightweight overlay for keeping track of your grade progress while streaming, be it for speedruns and whatnot.

The software has only two hotkeys.
'[' - -1 Pip
']' - +1 Pip

DISCLAIMER:
I have no idea who created this before me, I saw something pretty much exactly like this being used by different streamers and I couldn't find the one that they were using so I decided to make it for myself with the help of Gemini.
I am not a developer by any means.
